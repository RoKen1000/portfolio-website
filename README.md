# Summary
My first project after the Northcoders bootcamp is now complete and I am proud to announce that my Portfolio Website is now live. I built this website from scratch using JavaScript, React, JSX and CSS. It is fully responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop views.

# Experience Gained
This has helped me improve my front-end development skills greatly by understanding how to properly use various different position properties in CSS, as well as improving my knowledge of React by using the useRef() hook to periodically change the text in the “Experienced in…” part of the homepage which appears for desktop-sized views.

# Libraries Used
This has been a great opportunity for me to look at and utilise other libraries for use with React, in particular React Bootstrap and Framer Motion. 

With React Bootstrap I used their card grid system to create the cards seen in the Skills and Portfolio sections as well as the Offcanvas element to create the navigation panel for mobile-sized viewports. 

Framer Motion is what powers the seamless page transitions when navigating from one section to the next. This is achieved using the AnimatePresence component which triggers whenever components are added to or removed from the DOM. It also creates the rotating effect seen in the “Experienced in…” text as well as the fade-in for the text and image seen on the homepage. 

# Submission Form
The submission form seen in the contact page utilises the <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" >FormSubmit API</a> to send emails from the submitted form.
